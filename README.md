# EcoFlow NUT Server

A Python-based NUT (Network UPS Tools) server that bridges EcoFlow River 3 Plus devices to Home Assistant via the standard NUT protocol. This allows you to monitor your EcoFlow devices as UPS devices in Home Assistant.

## üîã What This Solves

EcoFlow devices don't have native Home Assistant integration for battery monitoring. This NUT server bridges that gap by:

- Converting EcoFlow MQTT data to standard UPS protocol
- Enabling battery monitoring in Home Assistant
- Supporting multiple River 3 Plus devices simultaneously
- Providing real-time battery status, voltage, current, and temperature

## üéØ What This Does

- Connects to EcoFlow MQTT broker using your account credentials
- Receives live data from your River 3 Plus devices
- Parses binary protobuf messages to extract real device data
- Exposes battery data via NUT protocol on `127.0.0.1:3493`
- Compatible with Home Assistant NUT integration
- Supports multiple devices simultaneously

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreanjos/ecoflow-nut-server.git
cd ecoflow-nut-server
```

### 2. Configure Your Devices
```bash
# For single device
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your device serial and credentials

# For multiple devices  
cp config_multi.example.json config_multi.json
# Edit config_multi.json with your devices
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the Server
```bash
python3 simple_nut_server.py
```



## üìä Supported Data

- **Battery Charge** (percentage)
- **Battery Voltage** (volts) 
- **Battery Current** (amps)
- **Temperature** (celsius)
- **Charging Status** (CHRG/ONBATT)

## üè† Home Assistant Integration

1. Install the **NUT** integration in Home Assistant
2. Configure it to connect to your Pi's IP: `YOUR_PI_IP:3493`
3. Add your River 3 Plus devices as UPS devices
4. Monitor battery status in HA dashboard

## üîß Configuration

### Single Device
```json
{
  "device_serial": "YOUR_DEVICE_SERIAL",
  "mqtt": {
    "host": "mqtt.ecoflow.com",
    "port": 8883,
    "username": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_ecoflow_password"
  },
  "nut": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3493,
    "ups_name": "your_device_name"
  }
}
```

### Multiple Devices
```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "serial": "YOUR_DEVICE_SERIAL_1",
      "ups_name": "device_1_name"
    },
    {
      "serial": "YOUR_DEVICE_SERIAL_2", 
      "ups_name": "device_2_name"
    }
  ],
  "mqtt": {
    "host": "mqtt.ecoflow.com",
    "port": 8883,
    "username": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_ecoflow_password"
  }
}
```

## üìÅ Files

- `simple_nut_server.py` - Main NUT server
- `real_ecoflow_parser.py` - Protobuf message parser
- `config.example.json` - Single device configuration template
- `config_multi.example.json` - Multiple devices configuration template
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies


## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ERR UNKNOWN-UPS" in Home Assistant**
- Ensure the server is running: `python3 simple_nut_server.py`
- Check device serial numbers in config match your actual devices
- Verify MQTT credentials are correct

**No data received from devices**
- Check your EcoFlow app is working (devices online)
- Verify MQTT credentials in config file
- Check server logs for connection errors

**Home Assistant can't connect to NUT server**
- Ensure port 3493 is not blocked by firewall
- Check NUT server is running on correct IP address
- Verify Home Assistant NUT integration configuration

### Logs and Debugging

Enable debug logging by changing the log level in your config:
```json
{
  "logging": {
    "level": "DEBUG",
    "format": "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
  }
}
```
